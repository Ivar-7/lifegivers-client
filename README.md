# LifeGivers
LifeGivers is a compassionate digital platform dedicated to connecting donors with those in need of life-saving resources. Our mission is to simplify and streamline the process of donating blood, organs, tissues, platelets, cord blood, and bone marrow. We are committed to upholding stringent medical standards while ensuring the utmost privacy and security for all users.

## Problem and Solution
##### Problem: 
Donors who want to make a life-saving contribution often struggle to find a convenient and efficient platform to express their intent. Simultaneously, hospitals face challenges in sourcing critical donations promptly.

##### Solution: 
LifeGivers serves as the vital bridge between compassionate donors and hospitals in need. Our platform allows donors to easily register their intent to donate. We then relay this information to hospitals, enabling them to respond promptly and efficiently. This streamlined system expedites the donation process, ensuring that hospitals receive essential supplies in a timely manner. LifeGivers simplifies the connection between donors and healthcare facilities, making a significant impact on the availability of life-saving resources for patients in need.
