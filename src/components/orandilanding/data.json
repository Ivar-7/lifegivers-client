      "story": "I have dedicated 16 years of my career to LifeGivers in Kenya. I began as a Trainee Medical Laboratory Scientific Officer (MLSO) and steadily advanced to the role of Biomedical Scientist. Over time, I assumed the position of MLSO 2 in Research and Development, followed by leadership roles as a Team Manager in Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics and later in Red Cell Immunohaematology. I was subsequently seconded into an Organization Development Manager role. My journey with LifeGivers commenced when a friend introduced me to the blood bank at our Aghakhan facility in Nairobi. After interviews with both LifeGivers and a hospital laboratory, I knew without a doubt that LifeGivers was the place for me due to the warm and supportive atmosphere I encountered.",

Our focus is on cultivating red blood cells within a laboratory setting for human transfusions, marking a historic moment in medical science. It's essential to clarify that our innovative approach is not a replacement for traditional blood donations. Instead, we target specific patient groups like those grappling with Sickle Cell Anemia. Our lab-grown cells closely match individual patient needs, reducing exposure risks to various blood group antigens. This breakthrough could potentially reduce the frequency of procedures, significantly improving patients' quality of life.",
